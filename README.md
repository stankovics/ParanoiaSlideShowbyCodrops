# Paranoia Slideshow

**A slideshow page layout with a filter enhanced navigation effect on the images.**\
<span style="color:red">Used for learning purpose.
There are some of my notes commented out in JS files.\

### <span style= "color:blue"> **Codrops articles and tutorials are great and professional. You will see in their JS/CSS code all new stuff implemented. Personally I love that they are using BEM convention in CSS, JS Classes, code packages, JS architecture for better organizing of code... :heart: :heart: :heart:**<span>
